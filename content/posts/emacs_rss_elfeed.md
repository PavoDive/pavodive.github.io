It was very easy to configure Elfeed in Emacs to have all the blogs and news from the sites I like, together in Emacs.
In this short article, I share how I configured the Elfeed package with the RSS feeds of some of the blogs I enjoy reading. This is important for me because I often spend time filtering through a lot of content that I am not interested in on forums like [lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml) or [reddit.com](https://reddit.com). Using this method is also a way to avoid ads and go directly to the content I want to see.

## Elfeed

Elfeed is a package for Emacs designed specifically to aggregate feeds. Most websites provide feeds where they "broadcast" newly added articles. Elfeed processes that information and presents it as an ordered table, where you can see the titles of the blogs or articles along with some additional details.

To install Elfeed in Emacs, simply (you‚Äôll need MELPA or ELPA) do:

```
M-x package-install RET elfeed RET
```

Then, add this to your `.emacs` file:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x w") 'elfeed)
```

(You can use `C-x w` or any other keybinding of your preference, in case you already have something assigned to `C-x w`.)

Now, by invoking `M-x elfeed` or `C-x w`, you‚Äôll get a (not-so-impressive) empty screen. That‚Äôs because we haven‚Äôt added any feeds yet. üìù

## Adding the Feeds

To add feeds to Elfeed, simply use some code like this:

```lisp
(setq elfeed-feeds
      '(("https://url.del.feed/atom.xml" tag-name)))
```

`tag-name` is the label (or labels) you want to assign to the tags for that specific source. Check out these examples:

```lisp
(setq elfeed-feeds
      '(("https://planet.emacslife.com/atom.xml" emacs)
        ("https://xenodium.com/rss" emacs)
        ("https://lemmy.ml/feeds/c/emacs.xml?sort=Active" emacs)
        ("https://programming.dev/feeds/c/django.xml?sort=Active" django)))
```

## Enjoying the Result

Once you‚Äôve loaded those feeds, open Elfeed again and reload with `G` (`elfeed-search-fetch`).

The result should look something like this:

{{< figure src="/images/scshot_elfeed.png" attr="Screenshot of elfeed" align=center link="/images/scshot_elfeed.png" target="_blank" >}}

Now you can navigate between different posts, perform searches, and read the articles that spark your interest.

Navigation within this screen is possible with the shortcuts you‚Äôve configured for moving to the next and previous lines (`C-n` and `C-p` in vanilla Emacs), along with `n` (`next-line`) and `p` (`previous-line`). You can mark entries you‚Äôre not interested in as "read" using `r` (`elfeed-search-untag-all-unread`), or read them directly with `RET` (`elfeed-search-show-entry`).

The search functionality is triggered using `s` (`elfeed-search-live-filter`). It‚Äôs an incremental search, and you can filter results by dates and tags:

- Writing "lis" after invoking the search will display results containing:
    - The word "list"
    - The word "lisp"
    - The word "eslip"
    - The word "playlist"

There are also other keyboard shortcuts you can explore‚Äîmake sure to check them with `C-h m` or simply by pressing `h` (`describe-mode`).

## Reading a Post

To read an entry, select it and press `RET`. That‚Äôs all there is to it. In the majority of cases, the post will appear in Emacs, allowing you to read it right there. In cases where you prefer to read it in your system‚Äôs web browser, press `b` (`elfeed-search-browse-url`), and the post will open in your browser.

{{< figure src="/images/scshot_elfeed_post.png" attr="Reading a post in emacs" align=center link="/images/scshot_elfeed_post.png" target="_blank" >}}

The same post appears like this in my browser:

{{< figure src="/images/scshot_elfeed_browser.png" attr="Reading the same entry in Firefox" align=center link="/images/scshot_elfeed_browser.png" target="_blank" >}}

A very interesting behavior of `b` is that it opens the post in a browser tab while **simultaneously** advancing to the next line in Elfeed. When you‚Äôve used `b` for several entries you‚Äôre interested in, you‚Äôll have multiple new tabs open in your browser.

But to tell the truth, I‚Äôd rather read them in Emacs itself üòâ.
